### âœ¿ Kerria is a tool that helps to:
- Integrate manifests from various sources (Kustomize, Helm , Jsonnet, Github API, and more)
- Build configuration ahead-of-time so that inflation of manifests does not happen at runtime in the CD controller
- Ensure the integrity of dependancies and build output.
